## What?

Like the description says, an experiment in adding syntactic support for monads to CoffeeScript

## But why?

Largely inspired [this article](http://codon.com/refactoring-ruby-with-monads) about monads in Ruby. The fun stuff he does with `method_missing` isn't super easy in CS/JS, so adding it at the syntax level seemed like a good idea.

Plus, having good syntactic sugar for things (even when they're already possible in a slightly clunkier way) means they're more likely to be used.

## These aren't actually monads...

Yeah, probably. 

I'm still kind of working on my understanding of these little guys. Hopefully, as I stumble through the implementation, I'll be able to properlly figure them out. Explanations of things I've gotten wrong are super welcome.
